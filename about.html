              <p>
                I’ve always been curious about how things work — whether in sports, travel, or technology.  
                  Football taught me discipline, travel gave me perspective, and that same curiosity eventually  
                  led me to explore how AI could make our lives simpler and smarter.

      <!-- ===== WHY I STARTED + BACKGROUND ===== -->
      <section class="section">
        <div class="container grid-two">
          <div>
            <h2>My vision about AI</h2>
            <p>
              My interest in AI started when I realized how much time we spend on repetitive, manual tasks — and how often our creativity gets buried under routine. 
              During my early projects in data and consulting, I kept asking myself: Why are we still doing things the hard way when technology could help us think better?
            </p>
            <p>
              That question never left me. It pushed me to explore how AI could simplify the complex, turn data into clarity, and make work feel more human. 
              Over time, I stopped seeing AI as just a tool  it became a way to amplify curiosity and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe AI is for everyone. With the tools we have today, anyone can use it to learn faster, automate what slows them down, 
              and focus on what truly matters. My goal with IBK Blogs is to make AI approachable — to show that you don’t need to be a researcher or coder to 
              benefit from it. You just need curiosity and a willingness to experiment.
            </p>
          
            <hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background: #222; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <h2>Why I started IBK Blogs</h2>
            <p>
              IBK Blogs is where that belief turns into action. It’s my space to share how AI can actually fit into 
              everyday life — through small projects, automations, and workflows that make work feel less mechanical 
              and more meaningful.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, I document experiments, lessons, and real use cases — not to impress, but to inspire others 
              to try. I want to show that AI isn’t just for tech experts; it’s for consultants, creators, students, 
              and anyone who wants to think smarter about how they use their time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, this blog is my way of exploring what’s possible when curiosity meets technology — 
              and of sharing that journey so others can do the same.
